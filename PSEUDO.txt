logic of this Game  - user will select a value and the computer will select randomly value
how does a user win this game?
R beats Scissors
P beats Rock

what data do i need to track in the app???
wins, losses, ties - create variables
computer selection - how am i going to have the pc randomly choose one of these 3 values R, P, S??
                     //0 ,   1,  2
var computerChoice = ["R", "P", "S"]
Math.floor()   Math.random()
once we have the user selection and random computer selection
we need to compare the two values to see if the user won, loss, or tied
if statement  if user wins - wins++
logical operators  &&  ||
can i use a function????
